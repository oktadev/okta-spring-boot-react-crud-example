# JUG Tours with Spring Boot and React
 
This example app shows how to create a Spring Boot API and CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) its data with a React app.

Please read [Use React and Spring Boot to Build a Simple CRUD App](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2022/06/17/simple-crud-react-and-spring-boot) to see how this app was created.

**Prerequisites:** [Java 17](http://sdkman.io) and [Node.js 16+](https://nodejs.org/)

> [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/) has Authentication and User Management APIs that reduce development time with instant-on, scalable user infrastructure. Okta's intuitive API and expert support make it easy for developers to authenticate, manage, and secure users and roles in any application.

## Getting Started

To install this example application, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-react-crud-example.git spring-react
cd spring-react
```

This will get a copy of the project installed locally. To install all of its dependencies and start each app, follow the instructions below.

To run the server, run:
 
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

To run the client, cd into the `app` folder and run:
 
```bash
npm i && npm start
```

### Create an Application in Okta

Before you begin, you'll need a free Okta developer account. Install the [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com) and run `okta register` to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run `okta login`.

Then, run `okta apps create`. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit. Choose **Web** and press **Enter**.

Select **Okta Spring Boot Starter**. Accept the default Redirect URI of `http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta` and use `http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:8080` for the Logout Redirect URI.

The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the `Everyone` group. You will see output like the following when it's finished:

```shell
Okta application configuration has been written to:
  /path/to/app/src/main/resources/application.properties
```

Open `src/main/resources/application.properties` to see the issuer and credentials for your app.

```properties
okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id=0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
okta.oauth2.client-secret=NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS
```

NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See [Create a Spring Boot App](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app-redirect/spring-boot/main/#create-an-okta-integration-for-your-app) for more information.

Run `./mvnw spring-boot:run -Pprod` and log in to your app at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Use Auth0 for OpenID Connect

If you'd rather use Auth0, that's possible too! First, you'll need to checkout the `auth0` branch of this repository.

```bash
git clone -b auth0 https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-react-crud-example.git spring-react
cd spring-react
```

Then, install the [Auth0 CLI](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli) and run `auth0 login` in a terminal.

Next, run `auth0 apps create`, provide a memorable name, and select **Regular Web Application**. Specify `http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/auth0` for the Callback URLs and `http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:8080` for the Allowed Logout URLs.

Modify your `src/main/resources/application.properties` to include your Auth0 issuer, client ID, and client secret. You will have run `auth0 apps open` and select the app you created to copy your client secret.

```properties
# make sure to include the trailing slash for the Auth0 issuer
spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.auth0.issuer-uri=https://<your-auth0-domain>/
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.auth0.client-id=<your-client-id>
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.auth0.client-secret=<your-client-secret>
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.auth0.scope=openid,profile,email
```

NOTE: You can also use your [Auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com) to configure your application. Just make sure to use the same URLs specified above.

Run `./mvnw spring-boot:run -Pprod` and log in to your app at `http://localhost:8080`.
